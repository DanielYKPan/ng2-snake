A Snake Game is an action game that consists of a snake that is constantly moving inside a grid. The player 
controls the direction of the snake, but the snake always keeps moving. When the snake eats something, it 
grows in size. If the snake touches the boundaries of the grid, or if it tries to eat its own tail, the 
game is over. The goal of the game is to keep the snake alive as long as possible.
